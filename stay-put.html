    <p>I decided to stay put and see what would happen. I waited in silence for what seemed like an eternity. Suddenly, I heard a loud crash from upstairs, followed by a deep voice. I knew I had to investigate, so I slowly made my way up the stairs.</p>
    
    <p>As I reached the top, I could see a door at the end of the hallway. It was slightly ajar, and I could hear a faint whispering coming from the other side. I cautiously pushed open the door and stepped inside. The room was dark and dusty, with cobwebs in every corner.</p>
    
    <p>In the center of the room, I saw a figure, shrouded in a dark cloak. I could barely make out the shape, but it seemed to be looking right at me. The figure slowly moved towards me, and I could feel my heart racing. I was about to turn and run, when the figure stopped and spoke. "You have come a long way, and you have two choices. You can either stay here and discover the truth, or you can leave and never know what really happened."</p>
