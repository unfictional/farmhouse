    <p>I knew I had to stay and find out the truth. I cautiously stepped forward and the figure slowly lifted its hood. To my surprise, I saw an old man with a kind face looking back at me.</p>
    
    <p>The old man smiled and said, "I have been waiting for you. I know why you have come. I will tell you the truth, but you must promise to keep it a secret." I nodded and the old man began to tell me the story of what happened in the farmhouse.</p>
    
    <p>The old man explained that the farmhouse had once belonged to a wealthy family, but they had been cursed by a powerful witch. The curse caused tragedy to befall the family and eventually, they had to abandon the house. As he spoke, I slowly began to understand the truth. I had finally found the answers I was looking for.</p>
    
    <p>I thanked the old man and made my way back down the stairs. I knew I would never forget this day, and the mystery that I had discovered.</p>
